# account-authenticator
<b>Account authenticator for android using OAuth 2.0</b>

This is an account authenticator library for android which gets you free from doing the chores needed for managing android accounts such as defining a bound service, authenticator xml, etc.

It takes five simple steps to get this library to work, which I have detailed them on <a>http://www.digigene.com/android/accounts-in-android-sample-app/</a>.

For those who are interested in the library itself or would like to know more about the details of the account management in android, I strongly recommend to read the three posts starting from <a href=http://www.digigene.com/android/accounts-in-android-part-one/>here</a>. Otherwise, there is no need to do so for using the library.
